# Database Model Unification Fixes

## 1. Caching Service Unification

### Problem
There were multiple caching service implementations:
- [CacheService](file://d:\thanawy\src\lib\cache-service.ts#L33-L598) in [cache-service.ts](file://d:\thanawy\src\lib\cache-service.ts)
- [CacheService](file://d:\thanawy\src\lib\redis.ts#L57-L300) in [redis.ts](file://d:\thanawy\src\lib\redis.ts)
- [educational-cache-service.ts](file://d:\thanawy\src\lib\educational-cache-service.ts) was using the one from redis.ts

### Solution
Updated [educational-cache-service.ts](file://d:\thanawy\src\lib\educational-cache-service.ts) to use the unified caching service from [cache-service-enhanced.ts](file://d:\thanawy\src\lib\cache-service-enhanced.ts).

This ensures all parts of the application use the same centralized caching implementation with consistent features and monitoring.

## 2. Database Model Name Unification

### Problem
There was inconsistency in database model naming:
- Schema defined [SubjectEnrollment](file://d:\thanawy\src\types\settings.ts#L21-L24) model
- API routes were referencing non-existent `courseEnrollment` model
- No `Course` model existed in the schema

### Solution
Updated all API routes in the [courses/](file://d:\thanawy\src\app\api\courses) directory to use the proper models:
- Replaced references to `courseEnrollment` with [subjectEnrollment](file://d:\thanawy\prisma\schema.prisma#L70-L75)
- Replaced references to `course` with [subject](file://d:\thanawy\prisma\schema.prisma#L105-L119)
- Replaced references to `courseLesson` with [subTopic](file://d:\thanawy\prisma\schema-new.prisma#L343-L355)
- Updated progress tracking to use [topicProgress](file://d:\thanawy\prisma\schema-new.prisma#L416-L427) instead of `courseProgress`

### Files Updated
1. [src/app/api/courses/[id]/enroll/route.ts](file://d:\thanawy\src\app\api\courses\[id]\enroll\route.ts) - Complete rewrite to use subject enrollment
2. [src/app/api/courses/[id]/route.ts](file://d:\thanawy\src\app\api\courses\[id]\route.ts) - Updated to use subject model
3. [src/app/api/courses/[id]/lessons/route.ts](file://d:\thanawy\src\app\api\courses\[id]\lessons\route.ts) - Updated to use topic/subtopic structure
4. [src/app/api/courses/lessons/[id]/progress/route.ts](file://d:\thanawy\src\app\api\courses\lessons\[id]\progress\route.ts) - Updated to use topicProgress model
5. [src/app/api/courses/route.ts](file://d:\thanawy\src\app\api\courses\route.ts) - Updated to use subject model

## 3. Prisma Import Verification

### Problem
Potential issue with missing prisma imports in some files.

### Solution
Verified that all files using prisma properly import it from "@/lib/prisma". No fixes were needed as all files were already correctly importing the prisma client.

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Consistency**: All database operations now use consistent model names that match the schema
2. **Maintainability**: Single caching service implementation reduces code duplication
3. **Reliability**: Using the enhanced prisma client with better connection management
4. **Performance**: Unified caching with proper metrics and monitoring
